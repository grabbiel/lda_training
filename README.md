Submission evidence for Datafest 2023.

Idea:

1. Measure the semantic coherence in the current subcategorization system by conducting a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model on each of the subcategories pertaining to each category.
2. For each LDA model, a Coherence model is conducted thus obtaining the coherence scores per subcategory.
3. An average accross subcategories is taken per category.
4. We use a benchmark of 40-50% as the minimum for semantic cohesion.
5. Suboptimal coherence scores indicate overlapping and misclassification in the subcategorization.
6. We propose a new subcategorization system.
